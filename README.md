# django_bookshop

This is a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) project, which is a bookstore website: you can search for books, leave comments, likes. Administrators can add, delete, and modify books. I used Django, DTL, and also wrote CSS. 

## Setup
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Dimaks700/django_bookshop.git
$ cd django_bookshop 
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ python3 -m virtualenv myenv
$ source myenv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
