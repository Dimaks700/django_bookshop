# django_bookshop

This is a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) project, which is a bookstore website: you can search for books, leave comments, likes. Administrators can add, delete, and modify books. I used Django, DTL, and also wrote CSS. 

## Setup
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Dimaks700/django_bookshop.git
$ cd django_bookshop 
```
If you have a Docker:
```sh
$ sh runserver_docker.sh 
```

If you don't have a Docker:
```sh
$ sh runserver.sh
```
And navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:80/`.
